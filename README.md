# Football Referee Flags with LoRa Communication
Overview
This repository is the home to my engineering project: an innovative set of football referee flags equipped with LoRa technology for seamless and reliable wireless communication. Designed to revolutionize the way referees interact with each other and with game officials, this project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making on the football field.

Technology
At the heart of this project lies the use of LoRa (Long Range) technology, operating at the 868 MHz frequency for robust wireless communication over long distances. The project leverages the RAK3172 module, integrating an STM32WLE5 microcontroller, to achieve optimal performance and reliability. The entire system was developed in STM32CubeIDE, utilizing the Sub-GHz PHY library to handle the wireless communication aspects.

Mechanical Design and Testing
Beyond the software and communication technology, significant attention was devoted to the mechanical design aspects of the referee flags and the receiver. The project includes comprehensive mechanical design files, detailing the construction and assembly of the flags and receiver unit. Extensive testing was conducted to measure current consumption and communication range, ensuring the system's efficiency and effectiveness on the field.

PCB Design
A crucial component of this project is the custom-designed PCBs for both the flags and the receiver. The PCB designs are optimized for low power consumption and reliable LoRa communication, with careful consideration given to layout and component selection to withstand the rigors of a football match.
